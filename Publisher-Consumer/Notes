Implementing a Publisher and Consumer with Python using a Message Queue

• Kafka or RabbitMQ 
  - Kafka and RabbitMQ are both popular message brokers but are designed for slightly different use cases.
    Kafka is optimized for high throughput and scalability, handling large volumes of data and enabling the retention of messages
    for configurable periods, making it ideal for big data applications and real-time analytics.
    RabbitMQ, on the other hand, excels in traditional messaging scenarios where robustness and advanced message routing and queueing
    features are needed. RabbitMQ supports a variety of messaging protocols and is easier to set up for simple queueing requirements
    compared to Kafka's more complex clustering and topic management.
    I chose RabbitMQ.
    To set up RabbitMQ, I would be running it via Docker; alternatively, you could run RabbitMQ via a Kubernetes cluster. 

• Implement a Python program for the Publisher that sends messages to the "ABC" channel:

    1. • Import the necessary libraries:
        - import pika to allow the script to interact with RabbitMQ
        - import sys to exit the script when the user interrupts the connection attempt or during message sending.
        - import time to pausing the execution of the script for a specified amount of time.

    2. Connect to RabbitMQ - connect to the RabbitMQ server.

    3. Send the messages:
        - Input the number of messages and send every message to the consumer via the channel.

    4. In the main program execution:
        - Input the number of messages.
        - Input the RabbitMQ host.
        - Trigger the functions and close the connection.


• Implement a Python Program for the Consumer that subscribes to the "ABC" Channel and prints out the received messages:

    1. • Import the necessary libraries:
        - import pika to allow the script to interact with RabbitMQ
        - import sys to terminate the script if the connection to RabbitMQ fails after a specified number of retries.
        - import time to implement delays between reconnection attempts
    
    2. Connect to RabbitMQ - connect to the RabbitMQ server.

    3. Callback - Print the body of the message after it is received.

    4. Start consuming - set up the consumer to start listening for messages on the "ABC" channel.

    5. In the main program execution:
        • Input the RabbitMQ server.
        • Establish a connection to RabbitMQ.
        • Begin consuming messages.
        • Once the consumer is stopped, close the channel and the connection and print a message back; it is important to close
          the connection to save on resources.
