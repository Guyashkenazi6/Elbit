Understanding and Moving Multicast Messages Between Networks.

• Provide a clear definition of multicast and its typical use cases.

    Multicast - Refers to the communication protocol used for sending a single message or stream of information to multiple
                recipients simultaneously. 

    Unicast - Establishes a one-to-one communication channel.

    Broadcast - Sends to all network devices indiscriminately. 

    Multicast efficiently targets a specific group of interested receivers. 
    This is achieved by using specific multicast IP addresses that represent a group of recipients rather than single hosts.

    Typical Use Cases of Multicast Include:

        1. Streaming Media - Multicast is extensively used in the distribution of live video and audio streams, such as live television
          broadcasts or webinars, where the same data is simultaneously consumed by multiple viewers.

        2. Real-time Applications - Financial stock exchange data, auctions, or gaming applications where timely and synchronous data 
           delivery is critical.

        3. Software Updates - Distributing software updates to multiple computers within a network at the same time to save bandwidth and
           reduce server load.

• Describe the solutions or techniques used to move multicast messages between networks.

    Solutions for Moving Multicast Messages Between Networks:

        Moving multicast messages between different networks, particularly from one network to another isolated network segment,
        requires specific techniques because routers do not forward multicast traffic by default.

        1. IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol): IGMP is used within a single network to manage the membership of multicast groups.
           Hosts use IGMP to report their multicast group memberships to adjacent routers, but it does not facilitate multicast
           routing between networks.

        2. Multicast Routing Protocols: These protocols are designed to enable the routing of multicast packets across network boundaries. 
           Common multicast routing protocols include: 

           - PIM (Protocol Independent Multicast): Works in either Dense Mode (PIM-DM) or Sparse Mode (PIM-SM),
             depending on the density of group members across the networks. PIM-SM is more scalable for larger network architectures.
           
           - DVMRP (Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol): Uses a distance vector algorithm to determine the multicast path across
             the internet, similar to how RIP works for unicast routing.
        
        3. MBGP (Multicast Border Gateway Protocol): Used to exchange multicast source information between Autonomous Systems (AS).
           MBGP allows the multicast routing information to be integrated with unicast routing frameworks to streamline paths
           across disparate networks.


• Provide an example scenario to illustrate your explanation.

    Example Scenario

    A company is organizing a live worldwide webinar. Their main office in Israel is where the webinar is broadcasted from,
    and they need to distribute this live feed to their offices in Germany, Usa, and Switzerland.

    Solution:

    1. Setup:
       Each office network subscribes to the multicast group address 239.0.0.1. The Israel office uses a multicast source
       to send the stream to this address. 
    
    2. Local Network Handling: 
    Inside each office, routers use IGMP to manage which local machines join the multicast group
       and need to receive the webinar stream.

    3. Inter-Network Routing:
    - Using PIM-SM: The routers at each office are configured with PIM-SM. The Israel router acts as the RP (Rendezvous Point) 
      where all paths from different networks converge.
    
    - Path Establishment: When the webinar starts, the Germany, Usa, and Switzerland routers send PIM join messages towards the Israel RP.
      This setup establishes a multicast distribution tree rooted at the RP.
    
    4. Transmission: The webinar stream is multicast from Israel to the RP, and from there, it is distributed down the tree to the
       Germany, Usa, and Switzerland offices.

    This setup ensures that the webinar reaches all global offices efficiently, with minimal bandwidth usage and without sending
    separate streams across the internet for each location.
