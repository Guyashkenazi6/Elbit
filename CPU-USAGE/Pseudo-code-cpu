Pseudo-code for CPU Usage Monitoring and Notification System

1. Import necessary libraries
   - psutil for accessing system details
   - time for managing intervals
   - plyer.notification for sending desktop notifications

2. Define function send_notification(cpu_usage)
   - Input: cpu_usage (percentage of CPU usage)
   - Action: Display a notification with:
     - Title: "High CPU Alert"
     - Message: "Your CPU usage is at [cpu_usage]%. Please check your system."
     - Timeout: 10 seconds (notification duration)

3. Define function monitor_cpu_usage(alert_threshold, check_interval)
   - Input: alert_threshold (CPU usage percentage to trigger alert)
            check_interval (time in seconds between checks)
   - While true (infinite loop to continuously check CPU usage)
     - Get current CPU usage using psutil
     - Print current CPU usage to console
     - If CPU usage exceeds the alert_threshold:
       - Print alert message to console
       - Call send_notification with current CPU usage
     - Sleep for check_interval seconds

4. Main program execution
   - Get user input for alert_threshold and check_interval
   - Validate that inputs are numbers, otherwise exit with error message
   - Call monitor_cpu_usage with user-provided values
