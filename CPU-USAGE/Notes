Creating a service to monitor CPU usage and send alerts.

Steps to implement:

1. Python Script 
    - In the script, I implemented the use of edge cases, which is important, if the input is an invalid input, for example.
      I also changed the given 80% CPU usage target to an input (alert_threshold) for future changes.

2. Locate in Python how to monitor the CPU Usage 
    - Psutil module - library for retrieving information on running processes and system utilization. 

3. Select how to notify: Desktop notification using notification from the Plyer module
    - Desktop notification using the notification from the Plyer module.

4. Creating the script:

• Import the necessary libraries:
    - psutil for accessing system details.
    - time for managing intervals.
    - plyer.notification for sending desktop notifications.
    
• Define necessary functions:
    1. Send notification 
        - Sends a desktop notification when CPU usage exceeds the threshold.

    2. Monitor CPU usage
        - Monitors the CPU usage and sends a desktop notification if the threshold is exceeded.

• Main program execution:
    - Get the alert threshold and the check interval as an input and not as a set parameter.

The service would continuously monitor the CPU usage as often as set in the check interval input.
